	abstract = {It has been recognized that when a durable goods manufacturer sells its output, it has an incentive to produce at a rate that will drive down the market price of the product over time. Because anticipation of declining prices makes consumers less willing to invest in owning the durable good, selling can be self-defeating for the manufacturer. If the manufacturer instead leases the product, it can eliminate its own incentive to decrease the price over time, which allows it to extract larger rents from consumers. In this paper, we investigate how a durable goods manufacturer’s choice between leasing and selling is affected by a complementary product that is produced by an independent firm. We show that a durable goods manufacturer that leases its product has an incentive to increase prices (by limiting the availability of the product) in response to the availability of a complement. Because this potential for opportunistic behavior discourages output of the complement, leasing can also be problematic. As a result, the durable goods manufacturer faces a trade-off between leasing, which commits the manufacturer to not overproduce, and selling, which commits it to not underproduce. Our contribution is to identify this trade-off and show how a durable goods manufacturer can use a combination of leasing and selling to balance its strategic commitment across both its own market as well as the complementary market.},

The damaged good helps the monopolist to mitigate the Coasian time‐inconsistency problem. However, it may lead to a welfare reduction: low‐valuation buyers are induced to purchase the low‐quality damaged good early rather than buy the high‐quality original good later, and when the players are patient the surplus loss from quality reduction outweighs the gain from earlier consumptions. This welfare result contrasts with the previous literature based on a static framework.},

This paper assumes, "We assume that there is no way to change the quality of a good once it is produced" (p.238, para 1). The cost of upgrading a low-quality unit is the same as the cost of producing a high quality good from scratch.
This is relaxed in the case of Tesla: they offer to upgrade the car through a software upgrade, once you buy it.
In their case, the product quality is upgraded via software update.
In contrast, I am right now studying the situation when the product quality can be downgraded via software update.},

This is one of the questions their paper is studying. This is in line with what we are doing. We have the "with buybacks" and "without buybacks" case - this speaks to that.
Are upgrade discounts "buybacks" or "tradeins"?
How is our RQ different: We are determining when should a monopolist crimp their previous version. Our claim to novelty is that with software updates, sellers can crimp their durable good in period-2, which exposes them to the commitment problem. With updates, they can't credibly commit in period 1 to not crimping the product in period 2. Case in point: Apple.
We show that this crimping can be sub-optimal for the seller's profit.
One commitment mechanism is switching cost - if the seller can make the new version more difficult to switch to (can they do this in period 1?), while ensuring forward compatibility (so that v1 buyers can use v2 products - but we don't model this now), that can ensure that buyers don't switch - and that removes the seller's incentive to crimp v1 in T2.}

	abstract = {“Planned Obsolescence” is the production of goods with uneconomically short useful lives so that customers will have to make repeat purchases. However, rational customers will pay for only the present value of the future services of a product. Therefore, profit maximization seemingly implies producing any given flow of services as cheaply as possible, with production involving efficient useful lives. This paper shows why this analysis is incomplete and therefore incorrect. Monopolists are shown to desire uneconomically short useful lives for their goods. Oligopolists have the monopolist's incentive for short lives as well as a second incentive that may either increase or decrease their chosen durability. However, oligopolists can generally gain by colluding to reduce durability and increase rentals relative to sales. Some evidence is presented that appears to be generally consistent with the predictions of the theory.},

	abstract = {We consider the case of a monopolist supplying an improving durable product to a population that is heterogeneous in its valuation of product quality. In a two-period framework, we show that if consumers expect the product to improve in “present-value” terms, then intertemporal discrimination might result in the first-period marginal consumer being left with zero surplus and some higher-end consumers postponing purchase. The resulting trajectories for quality and price do not constitute a subgame-perfect equilibrium.

One of our conclusions is that the logic of profit maximization in the context of rational consumer choice imposes a demand-side constraint on the rate of product improvement. We also emphasize the disequilibrium consequences of improving a product so rapidly that high-end consumers are tempted to wait for a future new-and-improved version. Finally, the formulation adopted in the paper may be useful to understand observed differences in product improvement rates in different markets.},

That is, there is no credible strategy for the future product that the producer can commit to in the first period.

	abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the profitability of a selling and a leasing model by considering both software upgrades and different price discrimination strategies in a two-period model framework. Three price discrimination strategies are considered: inter-temporal, behavior-based, and a hybrid price discrimination strategy. We find that consumers’ inter-temporal purchase behaviors and a vendor's choice of price discrimination strategies make it possible for a selling model to be more profitable than a leasing model. More specifically, if the monopolist cannot commit to never using information about consumers’ past purchase behavior for price discrimination, the selling model is more profitable than the leasing model. We also find that if a selling model is adopted, the monopolist should choose the behavior-based price discrimination strategy with a reward for returning consumers; but if a leasing model is adopted, the monopolist should choose the inter-temporal price discrimination strategy with a rising price. We also extend our model to a duopoly market. Different from a monopoly case, we find that the selling model dominates the leasing model under the hybrid strategy, while these two models are equally profitable under the inter-temporal strategy. These findings provide new insights into the comparison of the selling and leasing models.},

To the extent the monopolist is able to rent his product rather than sell it, or to make binding promises about his future production, such problems are ameliorated. Given the inability to do the above, the monopolist is led to producing goods less durable than those produced by either competitive firms or monopolist returns. A reverse Averch-Johnson result--that monopolist sellers may invest less in fixed costs (including plant modernization and research and development) than would the renters--is shown. It is also shown that, even though sellers have less monopoly power than renters and nondurable-goods monopolists, it is possible that the seller will cause a greater deadweight loss than the other types of monopolies.},

@article{mehra_competitive_2012,
	title = {Competitive behavior-based price discrimination for software upgrades},
	volume = {23},
	abstract = {The introduction of product upgrades in a competitive environment is commonly observed in the software industry. When introducing a new product, a software vendor may employ behavior-based price discrimination (BBPD) by offering a discount over its market price to entice existing customers of the competitor. This type of pricing is referred to as competitive upgrade discount pricing and is possible because the vendor can use proof of purchase of a competitor's product as credible evidence to offer the discount. At the same time, the competitor may offer a discount to its own previous customers in order to induce them to buy its upgrade. We formulate a game-theoretic model involving an incumbent and entrant where both firms can offer discounts to existing customers of the incumbent. Although several equilibrium possibilities exist, we establish that an equilibrium with competitive upgrade discount pricing is observed only for a unique market structure and a corresponding unique set of prices. In this equilibrium, instead of leveraging its first mover advantage, the incumbent cedes market share to the entrant. Furthermore, the profits of both the incumbent and the entrant reduce with switching costs. This implies that the use of BBPD has product design implications because firms may influence the switching costs between their products by making appropriate compatibility decisions. In addition, lower switching costs result in reduced consumer surplus. Hence, a social planner may want to increase switching costs. The resulting policy implications are different from those prevalent in other industries such as mobile telecommunications where the regulators reduced switching costs by enforcing number portability.},
